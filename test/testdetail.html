                    <p class="paragraph">
                        A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a webpage. It is a series of vertical
                        and horizontal lines that create a matrix of intersecting points, which can be used to align and
                        organize page elements. Grid systems are used to create a consistent look and feel across a
                        website, and can help to make the layout more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="imgDescript">
                        Definition: A grid is made up of columns, gutters, and margins that provide a structure for the
                        layout of elements on a page.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../src/asets/Grid.png" alt="表格示意图" id="gridImg">
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        There are three common grid types used in websites and interfaces: column grid, modular grid,
                        and hierarchical grid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Column grid involves dividing a page into vertical columns. UI elements and content are then
                        aligned to these columns.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Modular grid extends the column grid further by adding rows to it. This intersection of columns
                        and rows make up modules to which elements and content are aligned. Modular grids are great for
                        ecommerce and listing pages, as rows are repeatable to accommodate browsing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Hierarchical grid: Content is organized by importance using columns, rows, and modules. The most
                        important elements and pieces of content take up the biggest pieces of the grid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="smallTitle">Breaking Down the Grid</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up of three
                        elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><span>Columns:</span>Columns take up most of the real estate in a
                        grid. Elements and content are placed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths are
                        generally defined with percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will vary.
                        For example, a grid on a mobile device might have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have
                        12 columns.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><span>Gutters:</span>Gutters: The gutter is the space between columns that
                        separates elements and content from different columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can
                        change based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger
                        screens, whereas smaller gutters are appropriate for smaller screens like mobile.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../src/asets/grid2.png" alt="表格适宜图">
                    <p class="imgDescript">Three elements make up any grid: (1) columns, (2) gutters, and (3) margins.

                    <p class="smallTitle">Examples of Grids in Use</p>
                    <p class="tinyTitle">Examples 1: Hierarchical Grid</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Our first example is from The <a>New York Times</a>. This screen utilizes a
                        hierarchical grid to create a newspaper-like reading experience. At desktop screen size, two
                        main columns make up the hierarchical grid. The most important news story takes up the most
                        space in the grid, the left column, followed by secondary and tertiary stories, which take up
                        the smaller column and modules on the right.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../src/asets/纽约时报.png" alt="纽约时报">
                    <p class="imgDescript">The New York Times uses a hierarchical grid to achieve its newspaper-like
                        reading experience. (We highlighted the columns in yellow, the gutters in blue, and the margins
                        in purple.)
                    </p>
                    <p class="tinyTitle">Example 2: Column Grid</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Our second example is from Ritual.com, a vitamin company. This design uses a
                        column grid to create an attractive visual experience. At this screen size, four consistently
                        sized columns make up the grid structure and elements are aligned to and within these columns.
                        The gutters, the spaces in between the columns, are also consistently sized and help the user
                        visually separate the different products. The margins are independently sized and are the same
                        between the left and right sides.
                    </p>
                    <p class="smallTitle">Benefits of Grid</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Using a grid benefits both end user and the designers alike:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designers can quickly put together well-aliged interfaces.</li>
                        <li>Users can easily scan predictable grid-based interfaces.</li>
                        <li>A good grid is easy to adapt to various screen sizes and orientation. In fact, grid layouts
                            are an essential component of responsive web design. Responsive design uses breakpoints to
                            determine the screen size threshold at which the layout should change. For example, a
                            desktop screen may have 12 grid columns, which may be stacked on mobile so that the
                            resulting layout has only 4 columns.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../src/asets/manyImg.jpg" alt="">
                    <p class="imgDescript">At the mobile size, Behance's one-column grid (left) was reflowed into a
                        four-column grid structure (right).
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Even more importantly, the grid is not a throw-away concept. It is used by both
                        designers and developers alike. Be sure to communicate with your developers the grid structure
                        used when creating the design, so they can implement it accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="smallTitle">Choosing and Setting Up Your Grid</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out
                        layouts and experiences for your user.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><span>Choose the right grid for your needs.</span> Take time to think through
                        what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical —
                        best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will
                        always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are
                        great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider
                        using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. For
                        example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit
                        design needs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><span>Spend time setting up your grid.</span> Once you have figured out what
                        type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns
                        and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to
                        prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is
                        generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your
                        device size decreases. Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set
                        up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.

                    <p class="paragraph"><span>Consider using an 8px grid system.</span>For most common devices, the
                        screen size in pixels is a multiple of 8. Keeping grid-component values at a multiple of 8 will
                        generally make it easier to scale and implement a grid.

                    <p class="smallTitle">Conclusion</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Grids not only provide designers a structure on which to base layouts, but they
                        also improve readability and scannability for end users. Use a good grid system that easily
                        adapts to various screen sizes.</p>
